            <p>
                The most sacred meeting place of the ancient civilization, where representatives of all three Orders
                gathered to decide the fate of storms, seasons, and the flow of cosmic magic.

                    Within the Triune Conclave, three pillars rise from a central crystal of infinite light.
                    Here, Unicorn wisdom meets Pegasus connection and Dragon power. Decisions made in this sacred space
                    are recorded not in books, but as patterns in the stars above—eternal, unchanging, and eternally
                    true.
                    Time had not yet begun; their choices shaped reality itself.
