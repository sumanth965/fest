                    In the era before time itself was measured, three magnificent races wove the fabric of reality.
                    Unicorns ruled from floating sanctuaries suspended among the stars. Pegasi carried glowing knowledge
                    through wind-swept skies. Dragons guarded the elemental cores and shaped the very balance of magic.
                    Together, they created a world where thought was language, light was architecture, and destiny was
                    written in constellations.
